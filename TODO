SHORT-TERM
- create Address object that covers all addresses and can convert from one to another
- load public key with x-only pubkey, ensure it works for several...
- TxWitnessInput/Script can take objects and call the appr. method to hexlify after inspecting the obj
- Check and fix potential vulnerabilities: https://github.com/karask/python-bitcoin-utils/security/dependabot

SEGWIT-related
- A '00' byte needs to be added for non-witness inputs in between witness (inputs-witnesses are 1-1!) automatically?
  . currently adding it manually works fine (see 3 inputs 1 output example)
  . think of clean way of automating this (auto-magically adding them could confuse users!)
- segwit v0 and v1 address object instantiates from address, witness program and script
  . are all used? test?
- add annex to signature hash (easy, just add in bytes or hex in the method and include)
- ControlBlock does not automatically construct the merkle path (expects it as input)

CLEAN UP 
- transaction (input, output, etc) .from_raw code
- segwit examples and get_transaction_segwit_digest 

TYPING 
- use stubs for mypy to get type hints for external libraries that don't support hints (for now using # type: ignore for external libs)
- python.analysis.useLibraryCodeForTypes is set to false for pyright to not auto-deduce types for external libraries that do not use hint stubs / mypy)

IMPROVE
- test proxy object extensively, students reports it fails sometimes
- make a new proxy object from scratch (test with at least 2/3 of bitcoin core RPC)

DOC-related
- add explicit documentation for each module before members...
- commit docs/usage/proxy.rst
- segwit in documentation
- create jupyter notebooks instead of above documentation?

tests-related
- improve test structure - similar to Bitcoin core 

SECURITY
- check https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wj6h-64fc-37mp and if/how it applies 

OTHERLIBS-related
- add to bitcoin-rpc lib option to ignore invalid ssl cert
  . needed to access remotely withut cert (for other validators from clients)
  . https://github.com/jgarzik/python-bitcoinrpc/pull/50
  . but not in a lib release yet
  . add config.ini option to optionally ignore cert so that it works when calling btcd remotely
- create HD wallet implementation - very simple - similar to the hdwallet lib that I wrap
- create block object and impl. .from_raw(..) instantiation

OTHER
- create script: clean-less-than-sats 100000 bc1q86gsg4t32...
- create test with 260 outputs (inputs too much trouble) - file: test_extreme_txs.py
- create test with script of 260 and another with 66000 commands
- maybe make RBF the default from now on (like Bitcoin Core)
  . will need to change all the tests, unless I add minor hack that uses RBF by default only for taproot
